This is xnirspec, a Fortran program that helps to visualise and manipulate
FITS images. The program was originally written by its author to reduce
spectroscopic data obtained with near-infrared spectrograph NIRSPEC, installed
in one of the Keck Telescopes (Hawaii). The code was initially developed
in Fortran 77, although some minor changes have been introduced (January 2023)
to compile it as Fortran 90 code (without trying to make full use of the
advantages of Fortran 90).

The program is first mentioned in Cardiel et al. (2003, ApJ, 584, 76; 
see http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...584...76C)

Installation example (Mac OSX):

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure FC=gfortran-mp-12 FCFLAGS=-Wall
$ make
$ sudo make install

By default, the maximum dimensions of the images are set to 4300 x 4300. To
allow different dimensions the code should be reinstalled defining the
parameters NXMAX (equivalent to NAXIS1), NYMAX (equivalent to NAXIS2) and
NXYMAX (the maximum value of NXMAX and NYMAX). For example:

$ ./configure FC=gfortran-mp-12 FCFLAGS=-Wall NXMAX=6200 NYMAX=5000 NXYMAX=6200

To include compatibility with SExtractor it is necessary to indicate the
location of its executable:

$ ./configure FC=gfortran-mp-12 FCFLAGS=-Wall SEXPATH=/usr/local/bin
