This is xnirspec, a Fortran program that helps to visualise and manipulate
FITS images. The program was originally written by its author to reduce
spectroscopic data obtained with near-infrared spectrograph NIRSPEC, installed
in one of the Keck Telescopes (Hawaii). The code was initially developed
in Fortran 77, although some minor changes have been introduced (January 2023)
to compile it as Fortran 90 code (without trying to make full use of the
advantages of Fortran 90).

The program is first mentioned in Cardiel et al. (2003, ApJ, 584, 76; 
see http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...584...76C)
