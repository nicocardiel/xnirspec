This is xnirspec, a Fortran 77 program that helps to visualise and manipulate
FITS images. The program was originally written by its author to reduce
spectroscopic data obtained with near-infrared spectrograph NIRSPEC, installed
in one of the Keck Telescopes (Hawaii). 

The program is first mentioned in Cardiel et al. (2003, ApJ, 584, 76; 
see http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...584...76C)
